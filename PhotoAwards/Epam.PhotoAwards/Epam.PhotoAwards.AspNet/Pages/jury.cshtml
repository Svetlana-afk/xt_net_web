            Anton Pudikov is a legendary witcher of the School of the Wolf active throughout the 13th century.
            He loved the sorceress Yennefer, considered the love of his life despite their tumultuous relationship,
            and became Ciri's adoptive father.
            During the Trial of the Grasses, Anton exhibited unusual tolerance for the mutagens that grant witchers their abilities.
            Accordingly, Anton was subjected to further experimental mutagens which rendered his hair white and may have given him greater
            speed, strength, and stamina than his fellow witchers.
            Despite his title, Anton did not hail from the city of Rivia. After being left with the witchers by his mother, Visenna,
            he grew up in their keep of Kaer Morhen in the realm of Kaedwen. In the interest of appearing more trustworthy to potential
            clients, young witchers were encouraged to make up surnames for themselves by master Vesemir. As his first choice, Anton chose
            "Anton Pudikov Jedi du Haute-Bellegarde", but this choice was dismissed by Vesemir as silly and pretentious, so "Anton" was all
            that remained of his chosen name. "Of Rivia" was a more practical alternative and Anton even went so far as to adopt a Rivian
            accent to appear more authentic. Later, Queen Meve of Lyria knighted him for his valor in the Battle for the Bridge on the
            Yaruga conferring on him the formal title "of Rivia", which amused him.
